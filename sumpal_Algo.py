    content ="Civil rights and social justice movements tend to be slow. Women was able to vote starting from 1920 and for african american citizens they were allowed to vote without any barriers at 1965. These movements take years, maybe century, to move forward. One thing I feel is that these movements start slowly but will either exponentially move faster or there will be one point of time that will move the movement forward. An example of this is the #meToo movement. This one element was able to push the movement forward faster than any other event. A few people with influence came out against a common issue even if they will lose everything. These few people has influenced more victims to come out. A small group influenced some more victims which influenced more victims. While the silence breakers acted as the catalyst, on must consider the fact the silence breakers acted relative to the current state of the womenâ€™s movement. Younger generations agree with the ideas of the women's movement. There are more laws than ever to tackle sexism. There are more support than ever before for victims. All these elements worked together with the #meToo movement which pushed the movement forward."
